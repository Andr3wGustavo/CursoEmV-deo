# Write a program that reads a value in meters and the exposure is converted into density and millimeters.
meter = float(input('Type a distance in meter: '))
print(f'{meter} meters is equal {meter*100} centimeters.')
print(f'{meter} meters is equal {meter*1000} centimeters. ')
# this program shows the convertions of a meter distance to centimeters and milimeters
