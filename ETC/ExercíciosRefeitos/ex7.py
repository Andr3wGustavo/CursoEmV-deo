# Develop a program that reads a student's two grades, calculates and displays his average.

grade1 = float(input('Type the first grade: '))
grade2 = float(input('Type the second grade: '))
print(f'The average between {grade1} and {grade2} is {(grade2 + grade1)/2:.2f}.')
# basicaly this shows the arthimetic average between two grades
